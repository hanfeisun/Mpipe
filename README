Package Dependencies
--------------------
	BioPython is used to input fasta sequence file.

	Bedtools is used to convert bed to fasta file (fastaFrombed) and sort bed by its position (bedSort)

Usage
-----
	Run the whole pipeline for first time:
    	$ pipe.py motif.xml input_summits.bed output_dir your_dir/assembly/humanhg19/masked/
	
	Test the integrity of a xml file and view it:
	$ motif_xml_view.py motif.xml

	Test the integrity of a fasta file and view it:
	$ seq_GC_view.py hg19.fa
	
	See other usage by:
